    <h1>2018: A reading list of my own</h1>

    <time class="single" datetime="2019-01-01T20:00:00+00:00">01 Jan 2019</time>

    <p>One of the rewards of being outside a formal education system is the greater freedom to get lost in the labyrinth of your own passions, accidental findings and mishaps. Here’s my attempt at following 2018’s ball of thread to some kind of sense.</p>
<p><strong>Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse</strong></p>
<p><em>“What could I say to you that would be of value, except that perhaps you seek too much, that as a result of your seeking you cannot find.”</em></p>
<p>My favourite read of 2018. Yearning to understand himself and the meaning of life (aka “enlightenment”), Siddhartha ventures into the world and travels many roads: that of an ascetic; a rich businessman and a sensual lover; an isolated but contented ferryman. He never quite finds transcendence in any one of these roles, and yet discovers it in the totality of his life. Through its deceptively simple prose <em>Siddhartha</em> evokes a powerful idea, that life cannot be understood through egghead pondering alone. It has to be lived.</p>
<p><strong>Civilization by Kenneth Clark</strong></p>
<p>The book I recommended the most to my friends in 2018 (Full disclosure: I found out about it through Paul Graham’s website), <em>Civilization</em> is a history of the Western world from around the Dark Ages onwards as told through its art. It leaves you with a feeling not dissimilar to an engrossing museum tour — as I have already waxed lyrical in my goodreads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2239940817?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">review</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie</strong></p>
<p>One of those books that can easily attract skeptical glances on the tube, <em>How to Make Friends </em>does give cliched advice on dealing with people: praise often, listen intently, take an interest. I heard its teachings were considered manipulative, but reading it left me with an impression of the opposite: Dale Carnegie insists that a kind predisposition towards other people cannot be faked. It ultimately reminded me of a Warren Buffet quote, <em>“The only way to get love is to be lovable.”</em></p>
<p><strong>The Courage to be Disliked by Fumitake Koga and Ichiro Kishimi</strong></p>
<p>This book introduced me to Adlerian psychology, of which I knew practically nothing, and upon completing it I couldn’t help but think of its similarities to stoic philosophy (then again, I find its traces in many self-help books…): its emphasis on personal responsibility, capacity for change and free will, and its attribution of psychological problems to our constant worrying about the things we do not control. The authors claim that the book takes the form of a Socratic dialogue between a “philosopher” and a “youth”, though I cannot recall if Socrates was ever questioned by a petulant teenager…</p>
<p><strong>Swann’s Way by Marcel Proust</strong></p>
<p>One of the great whales of literature (and this is just its first volume…), it proved as intimidating and awe-inspiring in its display of linguistic craftsmanship as I thought it would be. The number of asides and philosophical musings triggered by seemingly mundane details is mind-boggling, but it is also great entertainment–I particularly enjoyed <em>Swann in Love</em>: it features probably my favorite passages about the torments of jealousy that can befall an infatuated mind.</p>
<p><strong>The Sympathizer by Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong></p>
<p><em>“Remember, you’re not half of anything, you’re twice of everything.”</em></p>
<p>At times laugh-out-loud funny and at times heartbreaking, this is my new all-time favorite. It is an immigrant novel (in the form of a spy thriller), exploring, as you may expect, issues of displacement, belonging and identity — but what I especially love about it is that the narrative does not drown in self-indulgence. It is clearly personal, and yet there is a huge amount of historical research, especially on Hollywood’s depiction of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><strong>How Google Works by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg</strong></p>
<p>Two things written or said by Eric Schmidt have persistently been on my mind this year. First, on a <a href="https://mastersofscale.com/eric-schmidt-innovation-managed-chaos/">podcast</a> with Reid Hoffman, he mentioned how <em>flying</em> helped him improve his decision-making, inspiring me to try it out for myself (work in progress). Second, in <em>How Google Works</em> he wrote “Hiring is the most important thing you do”, and this has echoed in my mind long after I put this book down.</p>
<p><strong>Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age by Michael A. Hiltzik</strong></p>
<p>A fascinating account of the personalities, work practices and office culture that gave the world, among many other innovations, the first PC and the laser printer. I was amused to find that PARC ran a weekly discussion club akin to a seminar, called <em>Beat the Dealer</em>, where researchers could present a topic of their liking and–on most occasions–tear apart each other’s ideas, without ever getting personal. A practice I have become partial to in my own career.</p>
<p><strong>Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle</strong></p>
<p><em>“Intellect itself, however, moves nothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical”</em></p>
<p>A man obtains happiness, Aristotle argues, through living virtuously, morally and intellectually, and Aristotle discusses at length the virtuous ideals such as courage, justice, “temperance” and practical wisdom. You constantly find here the idea of the “golden middle”, that moral virtues are the mean between two extremes (like courage is the mean between cowardice and rashness). Considering how much of Western ethics supposedly descends from Aristotle, this was an elucidating book which demanded patience and persistence.</p>
<p><strong>Roma by Alfonso Cuaron</strong></p>
<p>Roma is the most beautiful and poignant movie I’ve seen in 2018 (not that I’ve seen many). Filmed in black and white, it features stunning cinematography and incredible sound (the most beautiful sound of waves!): reminiscing, I feel like every shot and every scene were cinematographic poetry. It is a moving tribute to the sacrifices women can make to raise us, and during the screening I caught myself thinking about how unmanly (whatever that means…) men can be in a society fuelled by machismo.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t stumbled on an album in 2018 that I loved as much as <em>A Deeper Understanding</em> by The War on Drugs or <em>Ctrl</em> by SZA in the previous year, but I really liked <em>Golden Hour</em>. Uplifting, twisting disco and autotune with country, the best thing about it is its earnestness–it is absolutely disarming.</p>
