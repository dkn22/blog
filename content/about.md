Hello. If you got there somehow I suppose you like Douglas Adams, Monty
Python and computers. Not an unusual combination.

My name is Luiz Carlos Irber JÃºnior, currently an [Computer Engineering][] 
undergrad at [UFSCar][]. I worked for a year and a half
on Embrapa, gluing Python + GTK + GStreamer to do a video analysis tool
called [Sacam][] (althought I prefer to call it [BugBrother][], the
original project name before an official name was chosen).

For more information, go to [my site][] on the university server.
