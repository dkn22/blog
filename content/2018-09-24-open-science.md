Today I got a pleasant surprise: [Olga Botvinnik][0] posted on [Twitter][1]
about a [poster][2] she is presenting at the Beyond the Cell Atlas conference
and she name-dropped a bunch of people that helped her. The cool thing? They
are all open source developers, and Olga interacted thru GitHub to [ask][3] [for][5] [features][6],
[report bugs][4] and even [submit][7] [pull][9] [requests][10].

That's what open science is about: collaboration, good practices, and in the end coming up
with something that is larger than each individual piece. Now sourmash is better,
bamnostic is better, reflow is better. I would like to see this becoming more and
more common =]
