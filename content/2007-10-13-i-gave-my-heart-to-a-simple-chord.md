> People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching
> violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence
> will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands
> - literally thousands - of songs about broken hearts and rejection and
> pain and misery and loss. The unhappiest people I know, romantically
> speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most; and I don't know
> whether pop music had caused this unhappiness, but I know that they've
> been listening to sad songs longer than they've been living the
> unhappy lives.
