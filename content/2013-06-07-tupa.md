So, after two and a half years, I finally met [Tup達][1].

Curiously, it was only after I left INPE. [Arnaldo][3] came to Cachoeira
to visit us and I planned to show him the center, but I wasn't expecting
to do the whole tour. When I began working there they only showed the
public part, because Tup達 was off-limits at that time, and I thought it
still was since then. Well, me and everybody else that got into the group
after me... We went on a small tour to see Tup達, the engines, no-breaks
and all the electrical installation needed to support the building.

And it was **AMAZING!** I always liked more software than hardware, but it
is awesome to see things that you just knew from a SSH session. I could see
the tape library, disk arrays, the blinkenlights... It is in some ways the
physical manifestation of your code, or at least you have a better notion
of how many things are in motion when you execute something on the computer.

All in all, good times. It wasn't exactly what I expected at first, but I
made some great friends there, I could bike to work everyday, and I
learned (by trial and error) that you need to choose better who do you
trust. So it goes.
