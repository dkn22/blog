A quick announcement: I wrote a Rust implementation of [ntHash][0] and published
it in [crates.io][1]. It implements an `Iterator` to take advantage of the
rolling properties of `ntHash` which make it so useful in bioinformatics (where
we work a lot with sliding windows over sequences).

More info [in the docs][2], and if you want an ~~optimization~~ versioning bug
discussion be sure to check the [`ntHash bug?`][4] repo,
which has a (slow) Python implementation and a pretty nice [analysis][3] notebook.
