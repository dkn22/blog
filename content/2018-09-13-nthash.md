Title: New crate: nthash

Slug: nthash

A quick announcement: I wrote a [Rust implementation][5] of [ntHash][0] and published
it in [crates.io][1]. It implements an `Iterator` to take advantage of the
rolling properties of `ntHash` which make it so useful in bioinformatics (where
we work a lot with sliding windows over sequences).

It's a pretty small crate, and probably was a better project to learn Rust than
doing a [sourmash implementation][8] because it doesn't involve gnarly FFI
issues. I also put [some docs][9], [benchmarks][10] using [criterion][11],
and even an [oracle property-based test][12] with [quickcheck][13].

More info [in the docs][2], and if you want an <s>optimization</s> versioning bug
discussion be sure to check the [`ntHash bug?`][4] repo,
which has a (slow) Python implementation and a pretty nice [analysis][3] notebook.
