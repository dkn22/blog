Two weeks ago,
during the CS graduate orientation at [UC Davis][1],
the IT person was showing that we have access to 50 GB on [Box][2] and UNLIMITED storage on Google Drive
(I'm currently testing the limits of UNLIMITED, stay tuned).
I promptly forgot about Box because I've been using Syncthing for file syncing and it's been working quite well,
or at least way better than owncloud (which took infinite amounts of time to sync my stuff).

Anyway,
today I was checking [PaperShip][3] (wonderful app, by the way)
and noticed my [Zotero][4] free account was almost full (it is only 300 MB).
I knew Zotero had [WebDAV][5] support,
but I don't want to maintain a WebDAV server.
Turns out Box has [WebDAV support][6],
and even found [instructions][7] on how to set everything up.
